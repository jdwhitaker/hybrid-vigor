\frametitle{Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We found that accuracy alone is not a sufficient metric to evaluate classifiers that detect attacks. Rather, more granular metrics such as recall and precision must be considered.
  \item We found that neural networks can mine data to discover highly effective IOCs. 
  \item Neural networks generalize better to novel attack variants than IOCs.
  \item Hybrid classifiers that combine IOCs and machine learning can outperform both IOCs and machine learning alone.
