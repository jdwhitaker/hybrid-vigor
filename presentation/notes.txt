# narrative

## undergraduate background 
- when I was an undergraduate in computer science, I researched machine learning under my professor Dr. Junhua Ding. 
- The research problem was to apply convolutional neural networks to detect lung cancer from images of lung tissue
- The model we created worked well, but I didn't understand why
- I trained a simpler convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. I visualized the internals of the network and was able to demonstrate how it highlighted different parts of the input images to classify different handwritten digits.
- My senior year, I discovered cybersecurity and knew that was the career field I wanted.
- data science and machine learning have many applications to cybersecurity, but I my natural instinct to look under the hood has never gone away. 

## master's project
- Fast forward, and after working in cybersecurity for a few years, I'm enrolled in a master's program at SANS, and I have to pick a research project.
- At the time, I'm working with a third party detection tool that's marketed for its AI/ML capabilities. 
- As part of tuning the existing stock detection content and creating custom detections, I looked under the hood and found that some of the logic didn't make sense to me. For example, if a user accessed a service they'd never accessed before from an IP they've never logged in from before, then it would increase their risk score but not produce an alert. The alert would only fire if additional rules were triggered that caused their risk score to exceed some higher threshold. 
- I found that I'd rather have that case hard coded to always produce an alert. They've already logged in from an abnormal IP and accessed an abnormal service, and an attacker may have already accomplished his objective.
- Moreover, there are some countries we don't do business with who have IP ranges that should never login to any of our systems -- no machine learning required to know that's malicious. 
- This inspired me to research the tradeoffs between dynamic, machine-learning powered detections and static indicators of compromise (IOCs). My working theory was that static IOCs were being underhyped.  

# Research process
- I was fortunate to have as my advisor for this project David Hoelzer, who is -- in my opinion -- one of the undisputed experts of machine learning as it relates to cybersecurity.
